# Self-exciting negative binomial distribution process and critical properties of intensity distribution

https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06726

We employ the time-rescaling theorem, which enable us to sample data more efficiently than the rejection method. 

The time-rescaling theorem states that any point process with an integrable conditional intensity function can be transformed into a Poisson process with a unit rate. 

That is, it is possible to convert a makred Hawkes process into a makred point process process with a constant intensity of 1 by performing time-dependent rescaling.
